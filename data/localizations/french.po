Maybe they’ll recoup their losses—sell you do the derrick.\n\nkashio:\nIf you could work your way out, so can I.\n\nplayer:\nIf you do, you’ll deserve a fresh start. \nYou know, the thing you wouldn’t even let me have?\n\nnadan:\n!right\nThis isn’t what we agreed.\nShe was supposed to die.\n\nplayer:\nI made my choices. Thought you said that was alright.\n\nnadan:\nI did. And if I wanted it done my way, I should’ve done it myself.\n...\nYou said you’d never take the bounty to come after me.\n\nplayer:\nDidn’t say never. Just said I wouldn’t want to.\n\nnadan:\n...\nSomething to think about, anyway.\nSee you around, Sal.\n!exit\n\n* Nadan ducks out of the tent before reinforcements can arrive.\n* You leave by the front door, bounty in hand. \n}\n}\n\n{oolo_friend ? \n* {oolo} enters the room, and surveils the damage. {oolo.HeShe} finds you.\noolo:\n!right\nYou still breathing, Sal? \nplayer:\n!left\nSeem to be.\noolo:\nI dunno.

Figured the bounty would be worth more if she were alive.\n\nShe had valuable Spark Baron intel, I’ll bet. Inventions, discoveries—ancient ruins worth plundering.\n\nplayer:\nShe didn’t really give me much of a choice.\n\nBesides, there was more than shills at stake here.\n\noolo:\nHesh forbid I should show sympathy for you or anyone else, but—\nYou don’t look as jubilant as you should.\n\nplayer:\nYou know what’s stupid?\n\nI would’ve forgiven her. Five years in, seven years, even. All she had to do was come get me.\n\noolo:\nYeah… that is kinda stupid.\n\nBut I get it. Family baggage. I don’t have any but I’ve heard of it. \n\nplayer:\nKashio wasn’t my family.\n\noolo:\nNo, that’s for sure. Family wouldn’t sell you to the derrick, for a start.\n\nGet out of here, Sal. Get your bounty. \n\nAnd when you need something to keep you busy, come find me.\n\n* Oolo heads to the door, barking orders as a flood of Admiralty reinforcements arrive.\n* You look down one last time at Kashio, before taking what you need to claim the bounty.\n* You leave her on the floor without a backwards glance. No more looking back.\n}\n{not dead?\noolo:\nDon’t tell me you’ve left me a present.\n\nplayer:\nThere’s no Admiralty bounty for Kashio. But I figured you’d like to say goodbye before I haul her off for good.\n\nkashio:\n!right\n!injured\nAs if you haven’t just invited more yotes into your den.\nThere are Admiralty officers higher who won’t be happy at your initiative, switch. And they won’t make life any easier for either of you.\n\noolo:\n!left\nHey, I welcome the change of pace.\nAnd when has life ever been easy for Sal, huh? You ever seen a derrick?\nI bet Sal’s teeth still glow in the dark.\n\nplayer:\n!left\nIt isn’t about what’s easy.\nIt’s just about putting things right.\n\nkashio:\n!exit\n\n* Kashio turns away from you, so all you can see is the stubborn curve of her brow.\n\noolo:\n!right\nHesh speed, Sal. I’m sure I’ll see you very soon.\nWon’t be long before I’ll need someone with a bit of flexibility.\n\nplayer:\nWith this bounty, I’ll never need to work again.\n\noolo:\nHah! As if you’d retire now. \n\nI’ll see you when you’re bored, then. \n\n* Oolo heads to the door, barking orders as a flood of Admiralty reinforcements arrive.\n* You head out the back door, to keep your bounty from too many prying eyes. \n}\n}\n\n\n{not oolo_friend and not nadan_friend ?\n{dead ?\n* You look down one last time at Kashio, before taking what you need to claim the bounty.\n* You leave her on the floor without a backwards glance. No more looking back.\n}\n{not dead?\nkashio:\nYou’re about an inch short, kid.\nRevenge isn’t satisfied by mercy.\n\nplayer:\nOnly satisfaction I need is mine.  \nI spent too many years trying to be like you. \n\nkashio:\nAnd you learned better, huh? So what. You’re still standing here alone.\n\n* She ain’t wrong, but no doubt she’d have found something to be smug about. \n* You cuff her and walk her out the door.
