Not sure why I need to mind my scruples for this arrangement.\n        agent:\n            !happy\n            Well, if that's how it sounds, I'm not going to argue. \n            !wink\n            Just as long as you don't mind going where you're pointed, then I think we're in business. \n        player:\n            !dubious\n            ...\n            This sounds increasingly sketchy.\n        agent: \n            !handwave\n            It's simple, okay? I take my orders from the Cult of Hesh. That ain't so bad, right? Very holy.\n        player:\n            !crossed\n            Well, sure. 'Specially if it doesn't matter how many lumin laborers it took to see the divine.\n        agent:\n            !eureka\n            Right, Fssh mentioned you were an ik-Derrick. But all that means is you know what it's like to be on their bad side. And neither of us wanna be there.\n            !shrug\n            Look, you want into that auction or not? I'm offering you an opportunity.\n            I just need someone who can go where I can't and make sure the job gets done. \n        "
